### (1) Chocolate Cookies | 巧克力饼干

I don't like sweet food, but Pepperidge Farm cookies are way out of my expectation. Believe me, this is going to be the best cookie you have ever had, with only $3.89.

奇怪的不喜欢吃甜食的我，也完全禁受不住Pepperidge Farm的小饼干诱惑：相信我，这将是你吃过最好吃的饼干，没有之一！只需要$3.89的肥宅快乐，你值得拥有。

一包里面有两盒（如上图）这么多分量的饼干，放学回家吃两块，又可以满血复活好好学习了呢~





### (2) Kimchi Soup | 泡菜汤

I guess this is what happens when you watch so many Korean shows — my kimchi (Oops), my brain is filled with kimchi thoughts. Last Friday I walked all the way to Fresh International just for the kimchi and pork. Yum!

看太多韩国综艺的后遗症就是，满泡菜的脑子。上个星期实在忍不住，长途跋涉到华夏超市买到了梦寐以求的泡菜和五花肉，再到街角便利店买到了韩国辣酱。

Here is the simple recipe for making your own 20-min kimchi soup:

1. Heat the pan, and put in pork until it is slightly showing gold color on its surface.
2. Pour in 3/4 bowl of water (if you are cooking just for yourself), along with 2 teaspoons of Korean spicy sauce, some kimchi, tofu and mushroom. Put the lid on until water is boiling.
3. Now give it a try! Put some salt in before serving. Taste fantastic isn't it?

给自己做的**原料和诚意都满满**（货真价实的大胃王）的泡菜汤：

1. 锅微热，直接放入五花肉片煎至金黄。
2. 倒入适量水（考虑到马上要加菜，比想象中要倒少一点水哦），放入两勺韩国辣酱，一筷子泡菜，洗好的蔬菜（豆腐、金针菇等等）关盖子煮至水开。
3. 加入适量盐，就可以出锅啦！

方便快捷，20分钟内可以完工，非常适合我这种爱喝汤的懒人了。



### (3) Pringles | 品客烧烤味薯片

I used to hate BBQ sauce — i have a lot of trouble just with the smell of it in restaurants… until I gave Pringle BBQ a try. Sweet, salty, crispy, all mixed together to fill so many nights of mine that I felt desparate and lost. You are going to feel so much better (if you don't eat too much of it).

从前从前，我也是一个闻烧烤酱色变的人，直到有一天吃了一片品客烧烤味薯片--无限回购一点也不夸张。它陪伴我度过了大学里每一个失意与失落的时光，在漆黑的房间里咔嚓吃上几片，慢慢地给心情充值。



### (4) Yogurt | 酸奶

去年一年都在疯狂长痘，很长一段时间都不敢喝奶制品，现在皮肤调养好一些，尝试着买了一些酸奶屯在家里，可以早餐配面包一起吃。
